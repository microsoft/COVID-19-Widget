As the coronavirus impacts the world, we recognize the need to share the latest information outside of Bing. This widget will allow any site to easily add an outbreak map, the latest case counts, and a chart displaying the spread over time. These elements are modular, giving sites the ability to customize the experience. The widget is also responsive, adjusting automatically to desktop and mobile form factors. Learn more on how to embed and customize the widget for your needs below.

## How can I embed the widget on my site?
You will simply need to add two lines of HTML code, a ```<div>``` including various widget parameters, and a ```<script>```. At the bottom of this readme are code examples for the various supported configurations. Each configuration is a combination of three supported modules: an **Outbreak Map Module** showing the worldwide spread of the virus, a **Data Stats Module**, which displays the case count information for a given location, and a **Trends Chart Module** showing the spread of the virus in a location over time. Note that the **Trends Chart Module** has limited market support at this time. 

## How do I select a widget configuration?
You are able to select your widget configuration with the ```data-type``` parameter. We support the following values:

| Description   | ```data-type``` Parameter |
| --------- |:---------------------:|
| Default – includes all three modules: Outbreak Map module, Trends Chart module, and Data Stats module | covid19 |
| Map – includes only the Outbreak Map module | covid19_map |
| Trends – includes only the Trends Chart module | covid19_trends |
| Stats and Map – includes the Data Stats module and Outbreak Map module | covid19_stats_map |
| Stats and Trends – includes the Data Stats module and Trends Chart module | covid19_stats_trends |
| Modules - allowing for further customizations of multiple modules | covid19_modules |




In addition to these ```data-type``` options, you can also stack multiple widget on top of each other by including multiple ```<div>``` lines and only one ```<script>```. 

## How do I select the market and language?
The ```data-market``` and ```data-language``` parameters control the market and language of the widget respectively. The ```data-market``` refers to the country/region the widget will optimize for. The ```data-language``` refers to the UI display language in which the widget will display the UI string resources. Typically you will have the  ```data-market``` and ```data-language``` set to the same parameter value, however, there are cases where they would differ. For example, you can have a user in the United States who speaks Spanish. In this case you can set the ```data-market``` to en-US and the ```data-language``` to es-ES. We support the following values for  ```data-market``` and ```data-language```:

| Market   |  ```data-market``` Parameter |
| --------- |:---------------------:|
| Australia | en-AU                 |
| Canada | en-CA |
| Canada* | fr-CA |
| France* | fr-FR |
| Germany* | de-DE |
| India | en-IN |
| Italy* | it-IT |
| Japan* | ja-JP |
| South Korea* | ko-KR |
| Spain* | es-ES |
| UK | en-GB |
| US | en-US |
| CN | zh-CN |

* Markets with an asterisk (*) do not support the ```data-type``` of ```covid19_stats_trends``` currently. 

  
| Language   |  ```data-language``` Parameter |
| --------- |:---------------------:|
| English in Australia | en-AU |
| English in Canada	| en-CA |
| English in India	| en-IN |
| English in UK | en-GB |
| English in US | en-US | 
| French  | fr-FR |
| French in Canada  | fr-CA |
| German | 	de-DE |
| Italian | it-IT |
| Japanese | ja-JP |
| Korean | 	ko-KR |
| Spanish | es-ES |
| Chinese Simplefied | zh-CN |

## How do I specify a location for the widget to load?
The ```data-location-id``` parameter allows you to set location based on a set of available ```“/Country/Region"``` combinations. Setting the ```data-location-id``` will update all modules with the specified location's data. A list of the supported locations is available in the [AllLocations.txt file](../master/AllLocations.txt). If no ```data-location-id``` is set, the default is the global view. You can also select a global view for the ```data-location-id``` parameter with a value of ```"/"```.  

The Bing COVID-19 Widget team is also exploring adding support for location selection by latitude and longitude values. Please email bingcovidwidget@microsoft.com if this is a desired feature for your sites' widget implementation. 

## How do I select the widget size?
The widget is responsive, automatically resizing depending on the size of the parent HTML element. No additional settings control the width of the widget.
